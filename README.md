# AI-search-algorithms-coursework
Aim of this program is to demonstrate different path finding algorithms. Goal is to build a tower with agent in known enviroment, there are different levels of difficulty and different algorithms. 
I also implemented evolutionary algorithm, but it is not the best algorithm for this kinds of problems -> small change at the beginning can completely change end of the route -> two good parents won't have a good kid.
